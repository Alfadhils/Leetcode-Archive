# 1289. Minimum Falling Path Sum II

## Intuition
The problem requires finding the minimum falling path sum, where you can't choose two consecutive elements from the same column. 

## Approach
We can solve this problem using dynamic programming. We'll maintain a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum falling path sum ending at position `(i, j)`. We'll iterate through each row of the grid, updating `dp` accordingly. At each position `(i, j)`, we'll calculate the minimum sum by considering all possible choices from the previous row that don't violate the condition of not choosing consecutive elements from the same column.

## Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n^3), where n is the size of the grid.
- Space complexity: O(n^2), for the `dp` array.
## Code
```python
class Solution:
    def minFallingPathSum(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        n, res = len(grid), float('inf')
        dp = [[-1] * n for _ in range(n)]

        for j in range(n):
            dp[0][j] = grid[0][j]

        for i in range(1, n):
            for j in range(n):
                temp = float('inf')

                for k in range(n):
                    if j != k:
                        temp = min(temp, grid[i][j] + dp[i - 1][k])

                dp[i][j] = temp

        for j in range(n):
            res = min(res, dp[n - 1][j])

        return res
