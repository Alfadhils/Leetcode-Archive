# 1609. Even Odd Tree
## Intuition
The problem likely requires traversing the binary tree level by level and checking if certain conditions are met regarding the values at each level.

## Approach
1. Traverse the tree level by level using a queue.
2. At each level, check if the values follow the Even-Odd conditions specified in the problem.
3. For even levels, the values should be strictly increasing odd integers.
4. For odd levels, the values should be strictly decreasing even integers.
5. Keep track of the previous value at each level to compare with the current node's value.
6. If any level doesn't satisfy the conditions, return False. Otherwise, return True at the end.

## Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. We visit each node once.
- Space complexity: O(n), in the worst case, the queue can contain all nodes at the lowest level.

## Code
```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
from collections import deque
class Solution:
    def isEvenOddTree(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        if not root:
            # An empty tree is considered an Even-Odd tree.
            return True

        # Use a deque for efficient queue operations.
        queue = deque([root])
        level = 0

        while queue:
            prev_val = None  # Previous value at the current level.

            # Process all nodes at the current level.
            for _ in range(len(queue)):
                node = queue.popleft()

                # Check if the values follow the Even-Odd conditions.
                if (level % 2 == 0 and (node.val % 2 == 0 or (prev_val is not None and node.val <= prev_val))) or \
                   (level % 2 == 1 and (node.val % 2 == 1 or (prev_val is not None and node.val >= prev_val))):
                    return False

                prev_val = node.val

                # Add children to the deque.
                if node.left:
                    queue.append(node.left)
                if node.right:
                    queue.append(node.right)

            level += 1

        # All levels satisfy the conditions.
        return True
```
