# 576. Out of Boundary Paths

## Intuition
The problem involves finding the number of paths a ball can take to go out of the boundary of a 2D grid within a certain number of moves. The intuition here is to use dynamic programming to keep track of the number of paths for each cell and remaining moves. We can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right. If the ball goes out of the boundary in any of these directions, we count that as a valid path.

## Approach
The approach involves using dynamic programming to recursively calculate the number of paths from a given cell with a certain number of moves remaining. We memoize the results to avoid redundant calculations.

1. Define a recursive function `dp(x, y, moves, memo)` that represents the number of paths starting from cell `(x, y)` with `moves` remaining.
2. Base case: If `moves` is 0, there are no more moves, so return 0.
3. Check if the result for the current state `(x, y, moves)` is already memoized. If yes, return the memoized result.
4. Define the four possible directions to move: up, down, left, and right.
5. For each direction, calculate the new coordinates `(nx, ny)` after the move.
6. If the new coordinates are within the grid, recursively call `dp` with the updated coordinates and reduced moves.
7. If the new coordinates are outside the grid, increment `total_paths` as this represents a valid path out of the boundary.
8. Memoize the result for the current state and return the total number of paths.

## Complexity
- Time complexity: O(m * n * maxMove) - Each cell in the grid can be visited with a certain number of moves, leading to a total of `m * n * maxMove` possible states.
- Space complexity: O(m * n * maxMove) - The memoization table is used to store results for each state, leading to a space complexity proportional to the number of possible states.

This dynamic programming approach helps avoid redundant calculations and efficiently computes the total number of paths. The modulo operation `(10**9 + 7)` is used to handle overflow for large results.

```python
class Solution:
    def findPaths(self, m: int, n: int, maxMove: int, startRow: int, startColumn: int) -> int:
        def dp(x, y, moves, memo):
            if moves == 0:
                return 0

            if (x, y, moves) in memo:
                return memo[(x, y, moves)]

            directions = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]
            total_paths = 0

            for dx, dy in directions:
                nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy

                if 0 <= nx < m and 0 <= ny < n:
                    total_paths = (total_paths + dp(nx, ny, moves - 1, memo)) % (10**9 + 7)
                else:
                    total_paths += 1

            memo[(x, y, moves)] = total_paths
            return total_paths

        return dp(startRow, startColumn, maxMove, {})
