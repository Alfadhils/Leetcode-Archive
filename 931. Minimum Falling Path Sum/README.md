# 931. Minimum Falling Path Sum

## Intuition
The problem seems to be a classic dynamic programming problem where we need to find the minimum falling path sum. The idea is to build a table of minimum falling path sums starting from the top row and moving downwards. We can consider each cell in the table as the minimum falling path sum ending at that cell.

## Approach
- Initialize a 2D array `dp` to store the minimum falling path sums.
- Iterate through each cell in the matrix, and for each cell, calculate the minimum falling path sum considering the choices from the previous row.
- Fill up the `dp` array row by row, updating each cell with the minimum falling path sum.
- The result will be the minimum falling path sum in the last row of the `dp` array.

## Complexity
- Time complexity: O(m * n), where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns in the matrix.
- Space complexity: O(m * n) for the `dp` array.

## Code
```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def minFallingPathSum(self, matrix: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        if not matrix or not matrix[0]:
            return 0

        len_x, len_y = len(matrix[0]), len(matrix)

        dp = [[0] * len_x for _ in range(len_y)]

        for y in range(len_y):
            for x in range(len_x):
                if y == 0:
                    dp[y][x] = matrix[y][x]
                elif x == 0:
                    dp[y][x] = min(dp[y-1][x], dp[y-1][x+1]) + matrix[y][x]
                elif x == len_x-1:
                    dp[y][x] = min(dp[y-1][x], dp[y-1][x-1]) + matrix[y][x]
                else:
                    dp[y][x] = min(dp[y-1][x], dp[y-1][x-1], dp[y-1][x+1]) + matrix[y][x]

        return min(dp[-1])
