# 2709. Greatest Common Divisor Traversal

## Intuition

The problem appears to involve traversing through all pairs of elements in the given list, ensuring that each pair can be traversed through a series of greatest common divisor (GCD) operations.

## Approach

The approach taken involves sorting the input list in descending order and then iterating through all pairs of elements. For each pair, it checks if the GCD of the elements minus one is non-zero. If it's zero, it multiplies the second element by the first one. This process continues until all pairs are traversed or until it encounters a pair that cannot be traversed.

## Complexity

- Time complexity: O(n^2 * log m), where n is the number of elements in the input list and m is the maximum element in the list after sorting.
- Space complexity: O(n) for storing the set of unique elements in the input list.

## Code

```python
class Solution:
    def canTraverseAllPairs(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        n = len(nums)
        if n == 1 :
            return True
        nums = set(nums)
        if 1 in nums:
            return False
        if n == 1:
            return True
    
        nums = sorted(nums,reverse=True)
        n = len(nums)

        for i in range(n-1):
            for j in range(i+1,n):
                if gcd(nums[i],nums[j])-1:
                    nums[j]*=nums[i]
                    break
            else:
                return False
        return True
```
