# 1457. Pseudo-Palindromic Paths in a Binary Tree

## Intuition
The problem requires finding the number of pseudo-palindromic paths in a binary tree. A pseudo-palindromic path is a path where rearranging the values of the nodes in the path can form a palindrome. 

## Approach
To solve this problem, we perform a depth-first traversal of the binary tree. At each node, we keep track of the count of occurrences of each node value in the current path. We use a set to store the node values encountered so far. If a node value is encountered again, we remove it from the set, indicating that the count of occurrences is even. If it's not encountered, we add it to the set, indicating an odd count of occurrences.

At leaf nodes, we check if the number of unique node values with odd counts is less than or equal to 1. If so, we increment the count of pseudo-palindromic paths.

## Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree. We visit each node once.
- Space complexity: O(h), where h is the height of the binary tree. This space is used for the recursive call stack. Additionally, the set used for tracking node values has a space complexity of O(h), where h is the height of the tree in the worst case.

## Code
```python
class Solution:
    def pseudoPalindromicPaths(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        self.count = 0

        def dp(node, pairs):
            if not node:
                return

            if node.val in pairs:
                pairs.remove(node.val)
            else:
                pairs.add(node.val)

            if not node.left and not node.right:
                if len(pairs) < 2:
                    self.count += 1

            dp(node.left, pairs.copy())
            dp(node.right, pairs.copy())

        dp(root, set())
        return self.count
