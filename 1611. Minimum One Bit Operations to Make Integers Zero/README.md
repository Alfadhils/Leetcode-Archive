# 1611. Minimum One Bit Operations to Make Integers Zero

## Intuition
To approach this problem, we can observe the binary representation of the given integer `n`. Our goal is to transform this integer to zero using a minimum number of operations. We can notice that flipping a bit in the binary representation toggles its value, and we need to minimize the number of such operations. Therefore, we need to devise a strategy to determine the minimum number of bit flips required to reach zero.

## Approach
The provided code implements a solution to this problem. The approach involves iterating through the binary representation of the integer `n`. At each step, it calculates the contribution of the current bit to the final result, taking into account the toggling of bits.

The `state` variable keeps track of the current state of toggling. When encountering a '1' bit in the binary representation, it toggles the state. The result is updated based on the current state and the position of the bit.

## Complexity
- Time complexity: 
  - The time complexity of this solution is O(log n), where n is the given integer. This is because we iterate through the binary representation of the integer, which has a length of log(n).
  
- Space complexity:
  - The space complexity is O(log n) as well, due to the space required to store the binary representation of the integer.

## Code
```python
class Solution:
    def minimumOneBitOperations(self, n: int) -> int:
        binary = bin(n)[2:]
        length = len(binary)
        res = 0
        state = 0

        for i, bit in enumerate(binary):
            if bit == '1':
                state ^= 1

            res += (1 << (length - 1 - i)) * state

        return res
```
