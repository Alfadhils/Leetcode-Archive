# 380. Insert Delete GetRandom O(1)
## Intuition
The problem involves designing a data structure that supports three operations efficiently: insert, remove, and getRandom. The getRandom operation should return a random element from the data structure with equal probability. To achieve this, we need a data structure that allows for constant time insertion and removal, as well as efficient random access.

## Approach
The chosen approach is to use a set to store unique elements. The set data structure provides constant time average-case complexity for insertion, removal, and membership testing. For the getRandom operation, we convert the set to a list and use the `random.choice` function to pick a random element. This operation takes O(1) time on average.

## Complexity
- Time complexity:
  - Insertion (`insert` method): O(1) on average, as adding an element to a set takes constant time.
  - Removal (`remove` method): O(1) on average, as removing an element from a set also takes constant time.
  - getRandom (`getRandom` method): O(1) on average, as converting the set to a list and choosing a random element using `random.choice` are both constant time operations.

- Space complexity:
  - The space complexity is O(n), where n is the number of unique elements stored in the set. This is because, in the worst case, all unique elements need to be stored in the set.

## Code
```python
import random

class RandomizedSet:
    def __init__(self):
        self.set = set()

    def insert(self, val: int) -> bool:
        if val not in self.set:
            self.set.add(val)
            return True
        else:
            return False

    def remove(self, val: int) -> bool:
        if val not in self.set:
            return False
        else:
            self.set.remove(val)
            return True

    def getRandom(self) -> int:
        return random.choice(list(self.set))

# Your RandomizedSet object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = RandomizedSet()
# param_1 = obj.insert(val)
# param_2 = obj.remove(val)
# param_3 = obj.getRandom()
