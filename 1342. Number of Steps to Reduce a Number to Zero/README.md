# 1342. Number of Steps to Reduce a Number to Zero

## Intuition
The problem seems to be asking for the number of steps required to reduce a given number to zero by performing two operations: subtract 1 if the number is odd, or divide by 2 if the number is even. The goal is to find the minimum number of steps to reach zero.

## Approach
The provided solution uses a straightforward approach of iterating through the process until the given number becomes zero. In each iteration, it checks whether the number is odd or even and performs the corresponding operation. The count variable is used to keep track of the number of steps taken.

## Complexity
- Time complexity: O(log n)
  - In each iteration, the number is either divided by 2 (if even) or reduced by 1 (if odd). This process continues until the number becomes zero. The time complexity is logarithmic because the number of digits in the binary representation of the input is proportional to log(n).
- Space complexity: O(1)
  - The algorithm uses a constant amount of space, as it only requires a single variable (count) to store the number of steps.

## Code
```python
class Solution:
    def numberOfSteps(self, num: int) -> int:
        count = 0
        while num > 0:
            if num % 2:
                num -= 1
            else:
                num /= 2
            
            count += 1

        return count
