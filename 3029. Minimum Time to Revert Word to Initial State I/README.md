# 3029. Minimum Time to Revert Word to Initial State I

## Intuition
The problem requires finding the minimum time needed to revert the given word to its initial state. To achieve this, we can simulate the process of removing and adding characters to the word at each second until it reverts to its initial state.

## Approach
1. Initialize variables `n` to store the length of the word, `i` to `k` (as we start removing characters from the `k`th index), and `res` to `1` to represent the initial second.
2. While `i` is less than the length of the word:
    - Check if the suffix starting from index `i` onwards matches the prefix up to length `n - i`. If it matches, return `res` as this indicates the word has reverted to its initial state.
    - Increment `i` by `k` to move to the next set of characters.
    - Increment `res` by `1` to represent the next second.
3. If the word hasn't reverted to its initial state within the loop, return `res` as the minimum time required.

## Complexity
- Time complexity: 
O(n), where n is the length of the word. The while loop iterates at most n/k times.
- Space complexity: 
O(1) as we are using a constant amount of extra space.

## Code
```python
class Solution:
    def minimumTimeToInitialState(self, word: str, k: int) -> int:
        n = len(word)
        i = k
        res = 1
        while i < n:
            if word[i:] == word[:n-i]:
                return res
            i += k
            res += 1
            
        return res
```
