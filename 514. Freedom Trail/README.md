# 514. Freedom Trail

## Intuition
The problem seems to involve finding the minimum number of steps required to spell out a given word by rotating a ring. This implies a dynamic programming approach where we keep track of the minimum steps required at each step.

## Approach
We can start by preprocessing the positions of each character in the ring to optimize the lookup during recursion. Then, we can recursively iterate through each character in the key, calculating the minimum steps required to reach each character position in the ring. We memoize the results to avoid redundant calculations.

## Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n * m^2), where n is the length of the key and m is the length of the ring.
- Space complexity: O(n * m), where n is the length of the key and m is the number of unique characters in the ring.

## Code
```python
class Solution:
    def findRotateSteps(self, ring: str, key: str) -> int:
        memo = {}
        positions = defaultdict(list)
        for i, c in enumerate(ring):
            positions[c].append(i)
        return self.helper(0, 0, positions, key, ring, memo)
    
    def helper(self, in_index, pos, positions, key, ring, memo):
        if in_index == len(key):
            return 0
        if (in_index, pos) in memo:
            return memo[(in_index, pos)]
        min_steps = float('inf')
        for i in positions[key[in_index]]:
            if i >= pos:
                steps = min(i - pos, pos + len(ring) - i)
            else:
                steps = min(pos - i, i + len(ring) - pos)
            min_steps = min(min_steps, steps + self.helper(in_index + 1, i, positions, key, ring, memo))
        memo[(in_index, pos)] = min_steps + 1
        return min_steps + 1
